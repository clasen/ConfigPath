# üíæ ConfigPath

Welcome to **ConfigPath**, your go-to library for managing configuration files in Node.js applications with ease and flexibility! Whether you're working on a development project or gearing up for production, ConfigPath helps you handle environment-specific settings like a boss. üåü

## Features

- üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è **Automatic Environment Detection**: Automatically selects the right configuration based on your environment or the hostname of your machine.
- üõ†Ô∏è **Development & Production Support**: Supports separate configuration files for development (`*.dev.js`) and production (`*.js`).
- üìã **Easy Defaults**: Integrates seamlessly with default settings to ensure your app always has the necessary configurations.

## Getting Started

### Installation

Install ConfigPath with npm:

```bash
npm install config-path
```

### Usage

1. **Set Up Your Configuration Files:**

   Place your configuration files in a designated directory. Name them according to your environment or hostname, for example, `myapp.dev.js` for development and `myapp.js` for production.

2. **Default Configuration:**

   Create a `default.js` file in your configuration directory with common settings that apply to all environments.

3. **Initialize ConfigPath:**

   ```javascript
   const ConfigPath = require('config-path'); // Replace with your actual library name
   const configPath = new ConfigPath('./config');
   const settings = configPath.get();
   ```

   Now, `settings` will contain a merged object of your default settings and the environment-specific settings.

### Example Configuration File (`myapp.dev.js`)

```javascript
module.exports = {
    db: {
        host: 'localhost',
        user: 'myuser',
        password: 'mypassword'
    },
    api: {
        key: 'development-api-key'
    }
};
```
