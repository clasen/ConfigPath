# üöí Configre

Welcome to Configre, the coolest way to manage your project's configuration with a twist of personality based on your environment! Whether you're in development, testing, or production, Configre seamlessly adjusts to your project's needs by loading specific configurations tailored to each environment. Say goodbye to manual config tweaks and hello to automatic, hassle-free setup! üöÄ

## ‚ú® Features

- **Environment-Specific Configurations**: Automatically loads configurations based on the hostname or a custom profile passed via command line arguments.
- **Fallback to Defaults**: Uses a default configuration as a baseline, ensuring your application always has the necessary settings.
- **Easy Integration**: A simple setup process that integrates effortlessly into any project.
- **Support for `.js` Config Files**: Allows for dynamic configuration values and comments for better clarity.

## üåü Getting Started

To get started with Configre, follow these steps:

1. **Install the Library**

   First, make sure you have `Node.js` installed. Then, add Configre to your project:

   ```bash
   npm install Configre --save
   ```

2. **Setup Your Configuration Files**

   Organize your configuration files within a directory (e.g., `config`). Create a default configuration file and environment-specific files as needed.

   - `index.js`: Your default configuration.
   - `[hostname].js`: Override configurations for specific hosts.
   - `[hostname].dev.js`: Development-specific configurations.

3. **Use Configre in Your Project**

   Import and use Configre to load your configurations:

   ```javascript
   const cfg = require("Configre")(__dirname + "/config");
   console.log(cfg.db); // Access your db configuration
   ```

## üìö Example

Imagine you have the following structure in your `config` directory:

- `index.js`: Contains default settings.
- `myhostname.js`: Contains overrides for the host named `myhostname`.

Your `index.js` might look like this:

```javascript
module.exports = {
    db: {
        host: 'localhost',
        user: 'myuser',
        password: 'mypassword'
    },
    api: {
        key: 'development-api-key'
    }
}
```

And your `myhostname.js`:

```javascript
module.exports = {
    db: {
        user: 'john',
        password: 'johns-password'
    }
}
```

Configre merges these configurations based on your environment, making your app adaptable and easier to manage.
